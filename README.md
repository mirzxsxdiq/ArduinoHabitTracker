# **HABIT TRACKER (Hardware)**

This is a simple physical (hardware) habit tracker made using arduino nano as it microcontroller for me to enjoy tracking my habit.  
  
This project was a weekend project intended for me to fill up my time instead of just scrolling my phone away for hours. I used whatever is available at my disposal as I want to see whether it is possible for me to complete a project without buying new stuff. Luckily I did ðŸ˜Œ.
  
## **About**
  
The project uses ezButton library which can be obtained within the Arduino IDE. The library helps simplify the toggle switch code to few simple lines.

This habit tracker have a total of 4 LED, 2 red and 2 green. The project works by when it is powered up all red led will light up. There are two toggle switch one for each habit you are tracking. Once complete your habit you will flick the switch it corresponds to and the green LED will light up and red LED will shut off. Once both switch has been flick all LED will do some light flickering (animation). And after awhile all LED will light off. To reset for next day flick back all the switch to its initial state and the LEDs will reset to its initial state.

### **Tool Lists**
* Arduino Nano
* 2 Red LED, 2 Green LED
* Toggle Switch
* Resistor (for LED)
* 9V Battery and connector
* Small/Big Box (optional)

### **Software Used**
* Arduino IDE
* Fritzing

## **Disclaimer**

The amount of habit you are tracking can be increase by adding more LED and switch. I limit it to two as I can only fit those into the small box that I have. Bigger box means more LED you can fit into it. I spent more time trying to make the project look cool so I would use it often. Turns out I only use it few times ðŸ˜©.
